## Abstract
Predicting socioeconomic development of towns and urban regions is crucial for effective resource allocation and strategic decision-making by governments and businesses. Socioeconomic studies have traditionally relied on conventional statistical methods or qualitative analyses, which can be limited in their ability to capture the complex, multi-dimensional nature of development dynamics and adapt to evolving patterns in the data. Recent advancements in machine learning offer new possibilities for understanding and predicting socioeconomic changes. Ensemble learning methods and neural networks have shown promising results in various domains, sometimes combining multiple modal approaches to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. This study focuses on comparing the various statistical learning methods, from OLS to ensemble learning techniques like random forest and gradient boosting, in predicting socioeconomic ascent across Connecticutâ€™s census tracts. The project involves collecting and preprocessing a comprehensive set of socioeconomic indicators, training and evaluating multiple statistical learning models, and conducting a comparative analysis to identify the most effective approach. By providing insights into the relative strengths of these techniques, this research aims to support data-driven decision-making in urban planning, private sector investment, resource allocation, and economic development initiatives in Connecticut.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ed3260f-5504-4aed-b104-80e7c3b6c60a)
