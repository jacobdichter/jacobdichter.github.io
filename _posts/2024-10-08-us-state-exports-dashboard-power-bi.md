**Problem Statement**

U.S. businesses and trade professionals often lack accessible, product-level tools that connect state-level exporters with international markets. The lack of visibility hinders efficient market expansion strategies and opens up a path for risk mitigation in supply chains and informed policy-making. The US Exports dashboard addresses this by providing a Power BI app to explore export flows at the intersection of product, state, and destination country.

**Project Goal**

Empower businesses, policymakers, and analysts with a dynamic tool that reveals export patterns for specific product categories (based on HS4-digit codes), enabling strategic decisions in market entry, supply chain management, and economic development.
