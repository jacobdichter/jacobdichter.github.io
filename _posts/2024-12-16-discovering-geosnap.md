This blog post will cover the discovery of the geosnap library for Python and the solutions it provides to many of the problems encountered durin the development of my M.S. project.

Reference: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPH5521tDBE">Eli Knaap - geosnap @ SciPy 2024</a>

In his SciPy 2024 presentation, Knaap addresses many of the data gathering and pre-processing issues that encumbered my M.S. project. I spent an inordinate amount of time gathering disparate datasets, wrestling with inconsistent geospatial contiguity, and more. With geosnap, I believe an actionable predictive neighborhood model for Connecticut can be developed in a relatively short period of time, satisying my project requirements.
