2. Collect Historical Weather Data
Youâ€™ll need historical temperature data for the same calendar day over many years.

Options:

NOAA/NCEI Climate Data (link)

Meteostat API (free, Python-friendly)

Visual Crossing or Weather API (easy to use, but sometimes have usage limits)

Key data to collect:

Date

Temperature at race time (or daily high/low if hourly not available)

Optional: humidity, wind, etc.

3. Clean and Prepare Data
Extract temperatures from the chosen date (and optionally Â± a few days) for each year.

Handle missing values.

Normalize time zones and units (Fahrenheit vs Celsius).
