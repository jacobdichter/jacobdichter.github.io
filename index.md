<b>I explore the patterns that shape economies, societies, and industries—how data reveals underlying structures and hidden relationships.</b>

With experience in programming and statistical learning, I have worked with international commerce, economic sector analysis, commodities, and credit default data to analyze market trends and systemic dynamics.  

I approach data science as both a technical challenge and an intellectual pursuit—building models, designing pipelines, and extracting meaning from raw information. There is always another layer to uncover, another question to ask. The process is ongoing.

Developed a geospatial locality recommendation system leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including cosine similarity and k-means clustering, to analyze spatial data and user preferences. The system was designed to enhance town recommendations across Connecticut by identifying feature similarities between localities, enabling users to discover towns that align with their socioeconomic and lifestyle preferences. This project was part of a broader initiative to model socioeconomic trends and improve decision-making for policymakers and residents.

_________

A few suggestions: 
- Simple links as above. Can be short write-ups *or* just links to Kaggle notebooks or hosted Jupyter notebooks. I would suggest something like Chris Khan's [hosted notebooks](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/minimal-portfolio/projects/ames-house-price.html).


A few more Markdown notes:

Astericks can be *used* (1 *) for **emphasis** (2 **) and other formatting ~~choices~~ (2 ~~)

Unordered lists can be indicated with * or - or +

* I think
- Minus
+ Plus

We can also use `inline emphasis` with single backticks.

Code blocks can be inserted with triple ``` and optionally the name of the language right after opening:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({'Brand': ['Maruti', 'Hyundai', 'Tata',
                    'Mahindra', 'Maruti'],
                     'Year': [2012, 2014, 2011, 2015, 2012],
                     'Kms Driven': [50000, 30000, 60000, 25000, 10000],
                     'City': ['Gurgaon', 'Delhi', 'Mumbai', 'Delhi', 'Mumbai'],
                     'Mileage': [28, 27, 25, 32, 26]})
```
