A few suggestions: 
- Simple links as above. Can be short write-ups *or* just links to Kaggle notebooks or hosted Jupyter notebooks. I would suggest something like Chris Khan's [hosted notebooks](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/minimal-portfolio/projects/ames-house-price.html).


A few more Markdown review points.

Astericks can be *used* (1 *) for **emphasis** (2 **) and other formatting ~~choices~~ (2 ~~)

Unordered lists can be indicated with * or - or +

* I think
- Minus
+ Plus

We can also use `inline emphasis` with single backticks.

Code blocks can be inserted with triple ``` and optionally the name of the language right after opening:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({'Brand': ['Maruti', 'Hyundai', 'Tata',
                    'Mahindra', 'Maruti'],
                     'Year': [2012, 2014, 2011, 2015, 2012],
                     'Kms Driven': [50000, 30000, 60000, 25000, 10000],
                     'City': ['Gurgaon', 'Delhi', 'Mumbai', 'Delhi', 'Mumbai'],
                     'Mileage': [28, 27, 25, 32, 26]})
```
